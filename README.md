## Project 2

The purpose of this project is to build an interactive webiste for music fans who want to find concerts where ever they go using the Ticketmaster Developer APi.

We used Python for coding, Bootstrap for the website, Leaflet for the web mapping app, as well as Animate, Easing, Font-Awesome, JQuery.

All of the coding and raw data is on the Average Jos's Project Github account.
